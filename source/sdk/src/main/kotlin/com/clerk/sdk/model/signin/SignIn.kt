/**
 * The `SignIn` object holds the state of the current sign-in process and provides helper methods to
 * navigate and complete the sign-in lifecycle. This includes managing the first and second factor
 * verifications, as well as creating a new session.
 *
 * ### The following steps outline the sign-in process:
 * 1. **Initiate the Sign-In Process**
 *
 *    Collect the user's authentication information and pass the appropriate parameters to the
 *    `SignIn.create()` method to start the sign-in.
 * 2. **Prepare for First Factor Verification**
 *
 *    Users **must** complete a first factor verification. This can include:
 *     - Providing a password
 *     - Using an email link
 *     - Entering a one-time code (OTP)
 *     - Authenticating with a Web3 wallet address
 *     - Providing proof of identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
 * 3. **Complete First Factor Verification**
 *
 *    Attempt to verify the user's first factor authentication details.
 * 4. **Prepare for Second Factor Verification (Optional)**
 *
 *    If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for your application, prepare the second
 *    factor verification for users who have set up 2FA for their account.
 * 5. **Complete Second Factor Verification**
 *
 *    Attempt to verify the user's second factor authentication details if MFA is required.
