## Usage

### Creating a Clerk Application

1. [Sign up for an account](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?utm_source=github&utm_medium=clerk_android_repo_readme)
2. Create an application in your Clerk dashboard
3. Copy your **Publishable Key** from the API Keys section

### Installation

Add the Clerk Android SDK to your app's `build.gradle(.kts)`


```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.clerk:clerk-android:0.1.4")
}
```

> üí° **Tip:** Check [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.clerk/clerk-android)
> for the latest version.


### Initialization

Before using any part of the SDK, you must call `Clerk.initialize()` in your Application class with
your publishable key and application context:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.Clerk

class YourApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        Clerk.initialize(
            context = this,
            publishableKey = "pk_test_..." // Your publishable key from Clerk Dashboard
        )
    }
}
```

**Don't forget to register your Application class in `AndroidManifest.xml`:**

```xml

<application
    android:name=".YourApplication" 
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
    <!-- ... -->
</application>
```

### Initialize with custom options
```kotlin
import com.clerk.Clerk

class YourApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        Clerk.initialize(
            context = this,
            publishableKey = "pk_test_..." // Your publishable key from Clerk Dashboard,
            options = ClerkConfigurationOptions(enableDebugMode = true),
        )
    }
}
```

## Samples

#### Quickstart
`samples/quickstart`: This is a paired repo with the [Android Quickstart guide](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/android). It provides a simple
example of how to integrate Clerk into an Android application, demonstrating user sign-up, sign-in,
and profile management. See the [README](samples/quickstart/README.md) for more info

#### Custom flows
`samples/custom-flows`: This is a paired repo with the [Custom Flows guide](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview). It showcases how to
implement custom authentication flows using Clerk, including advanced scenarios like multi-factor
authentication and reset password. See the [README](samples/custom-flows/README.md) for more info

#### Linear Clone
`samples/linear-clone`: This is an example that shows how you might integrate with compose navigation, it is a native recreation of the Linear auth flow (which is web based)
and includes Sign in with Google, Passkey authentication, Sign out, and Email Code Authentication. See the [README](samples/linear-clone/README.md) for more info.
